# SOCI-enabled C++ project

## How to compile and run

1. Create and go into the build folder.

```bash
mkdir build/ && cd build/
```
2. Run CMake to generate Makefiles.

```bash
cmake ..
```

3. Run Make to generate the target.

```bash
make 
```

4. You can now run your compiled target file.

```bash
./soci-dev
```

## Issues
If you run into issues with CMake cache errors, try deleting the build folder and go through the steps again.
